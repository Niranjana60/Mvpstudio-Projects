This is a Automation project which was done to automate certain features for the Mars application in MVP studio.
Project Mars is an online trading platform for skills. Users can trade their skills and guests can search for skills to exchange. 
This platform provides the toolset to manage appointments as well as a smart rating and feedback mechanism to give insight to new users.
We used docker to test the development version of the app and it's a white-label skill trading marketplace platform.


Task 1:
● Create your own account on Mars website(via docker). 
● Play around with the application and start writing the test conditions and cases for Home -> ‘Share Skill’ and ‘Manage Listings’. 
Submit the project for feedback

Task 2:
● Automate test cases from Share Skills and Manage Listing modules. 

Technical Tasks
• Automation with Selenium Web Driver using C#.
• POM, Page Factory, Data-driven approach, NUnit, Extent Reports, Excel Data Reader and Asserts.
